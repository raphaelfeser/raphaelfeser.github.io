<meta name="description" content="Raphael Feser. Online and extended version of my CV. My training has provided me with foundations in the experimental techniques employed in medicinal chemistry. Additionally I have also been able to develop computational skills through my various experiences. I intend to use and develop these skills in exciting interdisciplinary projects contributing to a better understanding of the biochemistry of the human body, paving the way for the discovery of safer and more effective treatments.

## Main Project

Currently, my focus is on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of receptors in the human body, which play a crucial role in numerous physiological functions, making them important targets for drug discovery. A detailed understanding of their activation mechanisms, from drug binding to effector signalling, will improve rational drug design. I aim to achieve this by using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in conjunction with other molecular modelling methods.
