### Scientific Interests

<p align="justify">My education has provided me with solid foundations in experimental lab techniques but I have also been able to develop computational skills through my various experiences. I envision to use and develop my skills in exciting interdisciplinary projects contributing to a better understanding of human body biochemistry and supporting the drug discovery process, leading to safer and more effective treatments for patients.</p>
