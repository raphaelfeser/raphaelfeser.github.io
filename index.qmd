### Scientific Interests

<p align="justify">My training has provided me with a solid foundation in experimental laboratory techniques, but I have also been able to develop computational skills through my various experiences. I intend to use and develop my skills in exciting interdisciplinary projects contributing to a better understanding of the biochemistry of the human body, paving the way for the discovery of safer and more effective treatments.</p>
