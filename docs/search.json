Some proteins, called receptors, allow cells to sense\n        signals from their environment and translate them into intracellular responses. CCR5 is a\n        transmembrane receptor that guides immune cells by detecting chemical signals during immune responses.\n        It belongs to the GPCR family, the most widely targeted class of drug receptors. Drugs often act by\n        binding to receptors and changing their activity. Because CCR5 regulates immune-cell trafficking,\n        it is a promising target for modifying disease progression in inflammatory and cancer diseases.\n      \n      \n        In the default camera view, the bottom corresponds to the intracellular side and the top to the\n        extracellular side. The ligand binds at the extracellular face.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    02 The chemokines\n    A few amino-acid changes. Opposite effects.\n    \n      \n        CCR5 responds to chemokines, small signalling proteins. One example is CCL5, a chemokine\n        composed of about 70 amino acids. Researchers created modified versions of CCL5 by changing\n        only a few amino acids at its tip, the region that inserts into the receptor. Despite these\n        minimal changes, their effects are opposite: one blocks CCR5, while the other activates it\n        more strongly than the natural chemokine.\n      \n\n      \n        Tip of the chemokines, first 10 positions (out of ~70 total):\n        \n          \n\n\n\nMolecule\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n\n\nBlocker\npGlu\nGly\nPro\nPro\nLeu\nMet\nAla\nLeu\nGln\nSer\n\n\nActivator\npGlu\nGly\nPro\nPro\nGly\nAsp\nIle\nVal\nLeu\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        \n          ■ Identical   \n          ■ Variable positions (5–10)\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    03 The structure\n    The same receptor. The same binding site. Very different outcomes.\n    \n      \n        Both chemokines bind to the same region of CCR5 and insert their tip into the receptor in a\n        similar way. However, the\n        receptor responds differently. When bound to the activating chemokine, one intracellular helix\n        moves outward, allowing signalling proteins to bind inside the cell. With the blocking chemokine,\n        this movement does not occur. This suggests that activation depends not only on where a ligand\n        binds, but on how the receptor changes shape.\n      \n      Use the toggle above to compare the two structures.\n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    04 Watching it move\n    From structure to dynamics.\n    \n      \n        GPCRs are not rigid structures. They fluctuate between many shapes, only some of which can\n        signal. Ligands influence this balance by stabilising particular conformations. The outward\n        motion of the intracellular helix observed above reflects a shift toward an active state.\n      \n      \n        Molecular dynamics simulations describe how atoms move over time using physics-based\n        calculations. The animation shows CCR5 evolving along a simulated trajectory. The highlighted\n        helix moves outward as the receptor approaches an active geometry. These simulations help us\n        understand not only where a ligand binds, but how it reshapes receptor dynamics and stabilises\n        different functional states.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n    ← Previous\n    1 / 4\n    Next →\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Methods\n  Sampling rare transitions\n  \n    The conformational changes described above happen too slowly to observe in a standard simulation. The methods below accelerate this process.\n  \n  \n    At physiological temperature, a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory may remain confined to a single\n    conformational basin over accessible simulation timescales, missing slow transitions such as GPCR activation.\n    The underlying philosophy is shared with importance sampling in statistics: instead of drawing samples\n    directly from the distribution of interest, we sample from a modified distribution that is easier to\n    explore, and then recover the target distribution through reweighting or selection rules.\n  \n  \n    In this example, adaptive biasing is illustrated with metadynamics, which builds a history-dependent bias along\n    a chosen collective variable (CV), a low-dimensional descriptor of the protein’s configuration. The bias\n    discourages revisiting the same region and encourages transitions. Because the bias is known, free-energy\n    profiles along the chosen CV can be estimated afterward (illustrative). The ΔG slider below sketches how a\n    ligand or mutation shifts that balance.\n  \n\n  \n    \n      Illustrative free energy landscape for receptor activation\n      ● interactive\n    \n    \n      \n\n      \n        \n        \n          Sampling mode\n          \n            Standard MD\n            Adaptive bias (e.g., metadynamics)\n          \n          \n            Standard MD: a single trajectory may stay in its starting state.\n          \n        \n        \n        \n          \n            Ligand / mutation effect  Symmetric\n          \n          \n          Favours activeFavours inactive\n          \n            ΔG (active − inactive)\n            0.0\n            kcal/mol · illustrative\n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n        The two states are equally stable. Move the slider to tilt the landscape and see how a ligand or mutation shifts the balance.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Temperature replica exchange, also known as parallel tempering, follows a different strategy. Multiple copies\n    of the system are simulated simultaneously at a series of temperatures. Replicas at higher temperatures cross\n    energy barriers more easily and explore a broader range of conformations. At regular intervals, neighbouring\n    replicas attempt to exchange configurations according to a Metropolis criterion that depends on their potential\n    energies and temperatures.\n  \n  \n    In this way, configurations discovered at high temperature can gradually move down the temperature ladder.\n    Exchanges are accepted probabilistically, favouring configurations whose energies are compatible with lower\n    temperatures. As a result, the 300 K replica samples configurations that would be difficult to reach\n    through direct simulation alone while remaining consistent with the target temperature.\n  \n\n  \n    \n      Replica exchange (parallel tempering), illustration\n      ● interactive\n    \n    \n      \n\n      \n        Exchanges OFF\n        Reset\n      \n\n      \n        Illustrative. The 300 K replica (★) is the simulation with the temperature of interest.\n        Temperature replica exchange improves sampling by helping the system overcome energy barriers that would\n        be crossed only rarely at 300 K. Higher-temperature replicas explore conformations more easily,\n        and periodic exchanges allow these configurations to be tested at lower temperatures. Exchanges are\n        accepted probabilistically based on energy and temperature, so the 300 K replica ultimately\n        samples configurations consistent with its thermal conditions. Toggle exchanges to observe\n        configurations moving across the temperature ladder.\n      \n    \n  \n\n  \n    In my work, I often combine adaptive biasing and replica exchange within one workflow. It makes it quite powerful depending on the\n    system and question."
