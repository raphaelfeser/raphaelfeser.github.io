*Jan 2023 - Currently* <h5> **Trainee Pharmacist - Pharmacie de L'Ile** </h5>

<p align="justify">

This training is an integral and mandatory part of my doctorate of pharmacy where I ensure that patients receive optimal treatments (even in the current drug shortage environment) and proper advices. I also assist pharmacists in the final review of prescriptions, assessing their adequacy and safety. I am committed to working collaboratively with patients by involving them in their own care.

</p>



*Aug 2022 - Dec 2022* <h5> **Master's Thesis** - **University College London**</h5> **Prof. Shozeb Haider & Prof. Francesco L. Gervasio**

<p align="justify">

I studied the activation of human and murine LHCGR by an allosteric small molecule agonist using homology modelling and performing molecular dynamics simulation studies. I was able to highlight interesting drug-mediated activation mechanisms that may be useful for designing more potent drugs. Furthermore, the results suggest differences in human and mouse binding sites, implying that the use of mouse animal models is not optimal for predicting the structure-related effects of this drug. ([See here](docs/msc_thesis_rf.pdf))

</p>

<p align="justify">

Additionally, I was involved in the development of pancreatic cancer vaccines using patient neoantigens. To identify the most appropriate patient neoantigens, we had to determine which ones would trigger an immune response when recognized by T cells. To facilitate this process, I constructed structural models of the neoantigen-CMH complex and used the solvent accessibility of mutated amino acids as a predictor. Insights from these models were submitted to the clinical laboratory for further evaluation.

</p>



*Aug 2022 - Currently* <h5> **Student Research Assistant** - **University of Geneva** </h5> **Prof. Stephane Guerrier**

<p align="justify">

I conducted Monte Carlo simulation studies to compare methods and contributed to statistical modelling projects that may lead to peer-reviewed publications. This experience motivates me to explore how existing statistical methodologies can be adapted to address problems in molecular biology and drug discovery.

</p>



*July 2022 - Aug 2022* <h5> **Research Internship** - **Melanoma Institute Australia** </h5> **Prof Serigne Lo**

<p align="justify">

Using the world's largest melanoma database, I built a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model to evaluate the effectiveness of sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma patients. I used a range of statistical approaches, such as propensity score stratification, hypothesis testing, and descriptive statistics, to interpret the model's results and generated tables and graphs to present the findings.

</p>

*Jan 2021 - Apr 2021* <h5> **Open Synthesis Network** - **DNDi & University of Geneva**</h5>

<p align="justify">

Open Synthesis Network is a project in which students are involved in the early stages of neglected disease research. All students are tasked with synthesizing an analog of a previously identified hit with activity on Chagas disease. Using pharmaceutical chemistry techniques and the results of H-NMR, HPLC-MS, and FTIR analysis, I successfully ensured the synthesis and purification of my assigned analogue under the supervision of the lab team.

</p>

*July 2018 - Aug 2018* <h5> **Laboratory Assistant** - **Firmenich SA** </h5>

<p align="justify">

I prepared fragrance blends from laboratory compounds and in-house technologies for home care, body care and fine perfumery. Additionally, I was responsible for sample management tasks, including labeling, preparation for shipment, transportation to laboratories, inventory and disposal.
