## Professional Experiences

</p>

*Jan 2023 - Currently* \| **Trainee Pharmacist - Pharmacie de L'Ile**<p align="justify">This training is an integral and mandatory part of my doctorate of pharmacy where I ensure that patients receive optimal treatments (even in the current drug shortage environment) and proper advices. I also assist pharmacists in the final review of prescriptions, assessing their adequacy and safety. I am committed to working collaboratively with patients by involving them in their own care.</p>

*Aug 2022 - Dec 2022* \| **Master's Thesis - UCL**<p align="justify">I studied the activation of human and murine LHCGR by an allosteric small molecule agonist using homology modelling and performing molecular dynamics simulation studies. I was able to highlight interesting drug-mediated activation mechanisms that may be useful for designing more potent drugs. Furthermore, the results suggest differences in human and mouse binding sites, implying that the use of mouse animal models is not optimal for predicting the structure-related effects of this drug. ([See here](docs/msc_thesis_rf.pdf))</p>

<p align="justify">Additionally, I was involved in the development of pancreatic cancer vaccines using patient neoantigens. To identify the most appropriate patient neoantigens, we had to determine which ones would trigger an immune response when recognized by T cells. To facilitate this process, I constructed structural models of the neoantigen-CMH complex and used the solvent accessibility of mutated amino acids as a predictor. Insights from these models were submitted to the clinical laboratory for further evaluation.</p>

*Aug 2022 - Dec 2022* \| **Student Research Assistant - UNIGE**<p align="justify">I conducted Monte Carlo simulation studies to compare methods and contributed to statistical modelling projects that may lead to peer-reviewed publications. This experience makes me think about how existing statistical methodologies can be adapted to address issues in molecular biology and drug discovery.</p>

*Aug 2022 - Dec 2022* \| **Research Internship - MIA**<p align="justify">Using the world's largest melanoma database, I built a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model to evaluate the effectiveness of sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma patients. I used a range of statistical approaches, such as propensity score stratification, hypothesis testing, and descriptive statistics, to interpret the model's results and generated tables and graphs to present the findings. </p>

*Jan 2021 - Apr 2021*\| **Open Synthesis Network - DNDi** <p align="justify">Open Synthesis Network is a project in which students are involved in the early stages of neglected disease research. All students are tasked with synthesizing an analog of a previously identified hit with activity on Chagas disease. Using pharmaceutical chemistry techniques and the results of H-NMR, HPLC-MS, and FTIR analysis, I successfully ensured the synthesis and purification of my assigned analogue under the supervision of the lab team.</p>

*Aug 2022 - Dec 2022*\| **Laboratory Assistant - Firmenich** <p align="justify">I prepared fragrance blends from laboratory compounds and in-house technologies for home care, body care and fine perfumery. Additionally, I was responsible for sample management tasks, including labeling, preparation for shipment, transportation to laboratories, inventory and disposal.</p>

</p>

*Aug 2022* \| **Vice-Chairperson of the 4th IPSF EuRO Symposim**<p align="justify">I Appointed Vice-Chairperson in a team of 20 motivated student to organize a educative event gathering students from all over Europe. All of this with the appreciated support of the city of Bern, the Swiss U Change Fund and external sponsors</p>

*Mai 2022* \| **Guest Speaker at 132. BVT - Leipzig** <p align="justify">I participated in the national weekend of the BPhD (German Association of Pharmacy Students), where I spoke about the possibilities of student engagement at European and global level.br/>

*Mai 2022* \| **Delegate at the Geneva Health Forum 2022** <p align="justify">I was at the Fight the Fake Alliance's Booth speaking about the challenges and issues associated with substandard and falsified medicines. I also had the opportunity to participate in various sessions and have enriching exchanges.</p>

*Jan 2022* \| **Head of Public Relations - asep** <p align="justify">I was elected to the board of asep (Swiss Association of Pharmacy Students), responsible for a team aiming to maintain a good image of the association and to develop the association's relations with external stakeholders.</p>

*Oct 2021* \| **Delegate at the 43rd EPSA Annual Congress - Lyon** <p align="justify">I attended the congress of EPSA (European Pharmacy Student's Association) as an Offical Delegate to vote, debate and speak on behalf of the Swiss students</p>

*Oct 2021* \| **Guest Speaker at PsyKo 2021 - Leysins** <p align="justify">At the Swiss national psychology student's congress, I held a presentation on depressive disorders, with the perspective of pharmacy students, discussing pre-clinical research concepts and suggesting on the potential role of collaboration between pharmacists and psychologists</p>

*Aug 2021* \| **Delegate at the 66th IPSF World Congress - Seoul** <p align="justify">I Attended the congress as an Offical Delegate to vote, debate and speak on behalf of the Swiss students</p>

*Feb 2021* \| **Co-Host of the Digital Health Panel Discussion** <p align="justify">Co-organised and moderated a panel involving committed speakers from pharmacy, start-ups and academia to present their work related to digital health and answer students' questions.</p>

*Jan 2021* \| **Contact Person to IPSF** <p align="justify">Elected by asep to represent the Swiss students in the International Pharmaceutical Student's Federation (IPSF), which is the umbrella organisation for pharmacy student's association representing more than 500,000 students from over 100 countries worldwide. IPSF collaborates with many organisations such as WHO, UN, FIP, IFPMA and national stakeholders. I have supported student interests on topics such as education, the pharmacists' evolving profession and Global Health.</p>
