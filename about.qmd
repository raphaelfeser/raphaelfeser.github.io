# Experience




<h5>**Trainee Pharmacist - Pharmacie de L'Ile**</h5> *Jan 2023 - Currently*

---

<p align="justify">

This training is an integral and mandatory part of my doctorate of pharmacy where I ensure that patients receive optimal treatments (even in the current drug shortage environment) and proper advices. I also assist pharmacists in the final review of prescriptions, assessing their adequacy and safety. I am committed to working collaboratively with patients by involving them in their own care.

I studied the activation of human and murine LHCGR by an allosteric small molecule agonist using homology modelling and performing molecular dynamics simulation studies. I was able to highlight interesting drug-mediated activation mechanisms that may be useful for designing more potent drugs. Furthermore, the results suggest differences in human and mouse binding sites, implying that the use of mouse animal models is not optimal for predicting the structure-related effects of this drug. ([See here](docs/msc_thesis_rf.pdf))

</p>

![ORG43553 is a small molecule capable of activating LHCGR in vitro. This property is particularly interesting since the endogenous LHCGR receptor agonists are peptides. This ligand holds promise for the development of orally active drugs to replace the limited use of injectable CG and LH in the treatment of reproductive disorders and assisted reproductive technologies.](docs/gpcr_context.jpg){width="40%" height="40%"}

<p align="justify">

Additionally, I was involved in the development of pancreatic cancer vaccines using patient neoantigens. I created an automated program using Python and Unix Bash Script to build homology models of patient's neoantigen epitopes sequenced at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The structural insights gained from these models were used to predict the immunogenicity of the epitopes, aiding rational vaccine development.

</p>

![The image displays two illustrations of the same model of a neoantigen-CMH complex. The mutant amino-acid, represented by the spheres in both illustrations, exhibits a high solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). It is plausible that such solvent exposure may facilitate the recognition of the neoantigen as "non-self" by the immune cell encountering this complex, thereby eliciting immunogenicity.](docs/MEPfig_generate.png){width="60%" height="60%"}

I scripted Monte Carlo simulations in R to compare statistical methods, performed data analysis, and developed Shiny web application for visualizing the results. I also scripted custom bootstrap resampling script to estimate population parameters in training data sets.

<h5>**Research Internship** - **Melanoma Institute Australia**</h5>

**Prof. Serigne Lo** <br> *July 2022 - Aug 2022*

---

<p align="justify">

Using the world's largest melanoma database, I analyzed a dataset of 6,000 patients followed in a 17-year longitudinal study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma patients. I wrote scripts in R using a range of statistical approaches, such as Cox Regression Model and Propensity Score Stratification. From the analysis I generated tables and graphs to present the findings.

![Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can provide useful information about cancer progression, it also carries surgical risks. In my analysis, I created and interpreted several tables and graphs to assess the effectiveness of SLNB and determine appropriate patient selection criteria. This graph shows the melanoma-specific survival rates of patients who underwent SLNB (blue) versus those who did not (red).](docs/MSS_by_SLNB2.jpeg){width="85%" height="85%"}

<h5>**Open Synthesis Network** - **DNDi & University of Geneva**</h5>

**Dr SÃ©bastien Tardy & Prof. Leonardo Scapozza** <br> *Feb 2021 - Apr 2021*

<p align="justify">

Open Synthesis Network is a project in which students are involved in the initial stages of research into neglected diseases. All students are tasked with synthesising a molecule that has never been synthesised before. These molecules are analogues of a previously identified molecule active against Chagas disease. The general objective of the project is to test the activity, toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters of all these analogues in order to find a candidate and propose a SAR for the target. I successfully synthesised and purified my assigned analogue, using pharmaceutical chemistry process and analytical techniques such as TLC, H-NMR, C-NMR, HPLC-MS and FTIR results.

</p>

![This illustration offers an overview of the four essential steps that I employed in the synthesis of my assigned analog. The Hit molecule is displayed in the upper left corner, and it exhibited a micromolar level of activity against T.cruzi.](docs/osn.jpg){width="90%" height="90%"}

*July 2018 - Aug 2018*

<h5>**Laboratory Assistant** - **Firmenich SA**</h5>

<p align="justify">

I prepared fragrance blends from laboratory compounds and in-house technologies for home care, body care and fine perfumery. Additionally, I was responsible for sample management tasks, including labeling, preparation for shipment, transportation to laboratories, inventory and disposal.
